# nuhal_all - Cross-platform core implementation of NUHAL
Contains the portion of the Northwestern Utilities and Hardware Abstraction Library that
works on all platforms.  This library mainly provides source files that should be compiled
with a platform-specific implementation such as `nuhal_tiva` or `nuhal_linux`.

See the Doxygen documentation (<build_dir>/docs/index.html) for details about the API.
