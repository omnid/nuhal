# nuhal_all - Cross-platform core implementation of NUHAL
Contains the portion of the (Northwestern Utilities and Hardware Abstraction Library)[https://github.com/omnid/nuhal]

with a platform-specific implementation such as `nuhal_tiva` or `nuhal_linux`.

This library is developed as part of the [Omnid](../../omnid/cxx/index.html) project and its source code
is available on [github](https://github.com/omnid/nuhal).
